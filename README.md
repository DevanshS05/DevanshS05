### Hey, this is Devansh this side.
I am currently persuing my degree in **CS** from **Banaras Hindu University**.

First introducted to programming in middle school, I instantly fell in love with the idea of making and breaking things with coding. Since then I been learning programming on my own scouring the web.

I can code proficiently in Java / Javascript / C . I have also worked with C++ / Python / GoLang. 

Currently I am learning full-stack web-development with the MERN stack and Data Structures and Algorithms using Java and C.

My future interests lie in learning cloud-native technologies such as Kubernetes and the whole devops ecosystem and making projects which merge my love for technology and finance together.
